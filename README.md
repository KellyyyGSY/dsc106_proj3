**Map Visualization**

We use the *Internet Usage Data* as our dataset to achieve our visualization. Given the nature of the data (internet usage across countries/regions over time), a *choropleth map* was chosen as the primary visualization technique. Choropleth maps are effective for displaying variations in data across geographical regions. A *sequential color scale* from yellow, green to blue was selected to better emphasize the degree of internet usage, with lighter shades indicating lower internet usage and darker shades indicating higher usage. This choice ensures clear differentiation between countries with varying levels of internet penetration. The legend accompanying the map provides a visual reference for interpreting the colors, enhancing the user's understanding of the data. Upon clicking a country on the map, a line plot appears, showing the internet usage trend over the years for the selected country. Line plots are suitable for displaying time-series data, making it easy to observe trends and fluctuations over time. By showing the trend for a specific country upon user interaction, it provides detailed insights into individual country-level data. 

**Interactive Elements**

Regarding the interactive features of our visualization, we've integrated a *slider* right beneath the title, providing users with the flexibility to select the year they want to explore. This interactive tool empowers users to track the progression of internet usage over time, thereby facilitating temporal analysis. When users hover over different regions on the map, *tooltips* pop up, furnishing detailed insights into each country's internet usage for the chosen year. Moreover, we've implemented *click* event functionality and *blur* effects, accompanied by *line plots* for specific regions, to effectively illustrate the trends of using the Internet of the country over the years. Additionally, clicking on the blank area *resets* the map. Furthermore, the inclusion of a *search bar* allows users to effortlessly locate countries by name, streamlining access to specific countries of interest. The *ranking list* situated on the website's side permits users to switch between ascending and descending orders for global year ranks. This interactive feature furnishes additional perspectives on the distribution of internet usage across countries.

**Development Process**

Throughout the development of our project, we encountered several challenges and learned valuable lessons regarding collaborative work and technical implementation. Initially, our team divided the project tasks among three members, each responsible for distinct aspects. This approach necessitated a shared understanding and use of certain variables, such as the width and height of the SVG element and the handling of country data, which are integral to all parts of our visualization. However, early in the development process, we overlooked the importance of establishing a common framework for these shared variables. This oversight led to a significant amount of time spent debugging and tracing issues back to the lack of access to these crucial local variables. The choice of geographic projection was another area of development that required careful consideration. We initially leaned towards using the geoMercator projection but later switched to the geoNaturalEarth1 projection. This decision was made to minimize area distortion, which significantly improved the accuracy and aesthetic of our map visualization. These experiences underscored the importance of early planning and communication in collaborative projects, especially when dealing with complex data visualizations that require a cohesive approach to shared resources.

**Limitations**

The project, while successful in many aspects, also faced limitations that highlight areas for future improvement. One notable issue was the interaction between the suggestion research list and the world map visualization. When the suggestion list appeared, it inadvertently compressed the world map, affecting the overall layout and user experience. This issue points to the need for a more dynamic and responsive design that can accommodate additional elements without disrupting the existing layout. Furthermore, the persistence of the blur effect poses another limitation. After selecting a country and adjusting the timeline slider, the intended blur effect would disappear unless the country was clicked again, indicating a lack of state persistence across interactions. Additionally, the presence of duplicates in the suggested list was identified, likely stemming from multiple entries of the same country name with varying data points in our dataset. This issue not only affects the accuracy of the suggestions provided but also reflects the challenge of cleaning and preprocessing data to ensure a seamless user experience. If we have extra time, we will certainly first focus on addressing these limitations, which requires a thoughtful reconsideration of the design and implementation strategies to enhance both the functionality and the aesthetic appeal of the visualization.

**Challenges and Team Roles**
 
Throughout the course of our project, each team member dedicated approximately 20 hours, combining our diverse expertise to significantly enhance the interactivity and user experience of our visualization. Leveraging Yanhao's preprocessed dataset from his previous project, we were able to quickly set up a detailed foundational map. This map boasted interactive elements such as sliders for temporal navigation, hover effects for immediate data visualization, and a comprehensive search interface allowing users to pinpoint countries effortlessly. Yishan and Kelly spearheaded the task of importing datasets and laying down the initial map and its projection settings, alongside their attributes. Kelly, in addition to initializing the GitHub repository for project collaboration, took the helm in incorporating interactive functionalities including hover details, zoom capabilities, and temporal sliders to navigate through different years. Yishan focused on developing the color legend and played a pivotal role in shaping the narrative for our project documentation. Yanhao enhanced the user interface interaction by implementing sophisticated click events(zoom in effects, blur effects, and reset function), Country search functions (search suggestions), slidable Ranking list (Clickable) and dynamic line plots for more detailed region analysis.

The project presented several challenges that tested our problem-solving skills and technical proficiency. One significant hurdle was perfecting the reset functionality after focusing on a specific country. While clearing the blur effect was straightforward, reimplementing the zoom reset proved to be a complex task that demanded extensive debugging and iteration. The development of a functional ranking list, which allowed users to interact with the visualization by selecting country names rather than directly clicking on the map, posed another challenge. This required us to extract the click functionality from its original scope within the drawChart function and make it globally accessible alongside several key variables. This adjustment was crucial for enabling seamless interaction between the search feature, the ranking list, and the map. It necessitated a considerable amount of time dedicated to debugging and refining our code, ensuring that each interactive element worked harmoniously to provide a cohesive and engaging user experience.
