**Map Visualization**

We use the *Internet Usage Data* as our dataset to achieve our visualization. Given the nature of the data (internet usage across countries/regions over time), a *choropleth map* was chosen as the primary visualization technique. Choropleth maps are effective for displaying variations in data across geographical regions. A *sequential color scale* from yellow, green to blue was selected to better emphasize the degree of internet usage, with lighter shades indicating lower internet usage and darker shades indicating higher usage. This choice ensures clear differentiation between countries with varying levels of internet penetration. The legend accompanying the map provides a visual reference for interpreting the colors, enhancing the user's understanding of the data. Upon clicking a country on the map, a line plot appears, showing the internet usage trend over the years for the selected country. Line plots are suitable for displaying time-series data, making it easy to observe trends and fluctuations over time. By showing the trend for a specific country upon user interaction, it provides detailed insights into individual country-level data. 

**Interactive Elements**

Regarding the interactive features of our visualization, we've integrated a *slider* right beneath the title, providing users with the flexibility to select the year they want to explore. This interactive tool empowers users to track the progression of internet usage over time, thereby facilitating temporal analysis. When users hover over different regions on the map, *tooltips* pop up, furnishing detailed insights into each country's internet usage for the chosen year. Moreover, we've implemented *click* event functionality and *blur* effects, accompanied by *line plots* for specific regions, to effectively illustrate the trends of using the Internet of the country over the years. Additionally, clicking on the blank area *resets* the map. Furthermore, the inclusion of a *search bar* allows users to effortlessly locate countries by name, streamlining access to specific countries of interest. The *ranking list* situated on the website's side permits users to switch between ascending and descending orders for global year ranks. This interactive feature furnishes additional perspectives on the distribution of internet usage across countries.

**Development Process and Limitations**

Throughout the development process, the choice of geographic projections underwent some changes. Initially, we favored the geoMercator projection but ultimately transitioned to *geoNaturalEarth1* due to its reduction in area distortion. Also, it's important to note that data for both countries and regions is included in the original dataset, which is reflected in the ranking list. Clicking on a country's name in the ranking list directs us to its location on the map, but it would not be applied to regions such as North America. Additionally, when we click on a country's name in the ranking list, only the zoom effect happens, and we have to click on the region again to trigger the plot and blur effect. Lastly, after selecting a specific country, when sliding the slider, the blur effect would persist only if clicking on the country again .

**Challenges and Team Roles**

In our project, we contributed approximately 20 hours each, seamlessly integrating our unique skills and backgrounds to enhance the project's interactivity and user experience. Utilizing Andrew's preprocessed dataset from his Project 2 enabled us to efficiently establish a robust foundational map, complete with interactive elements such as sliders, hover effects, and a searchable interface to easily locate countries of interest. Yishan and Kelly took charge of importing datasets and establishing the foundational map and projection, along with their respective attributes. Kelly set up the GitHub repository, building, and deploying the website,and she also added interactive features such as hover, zoom in and out effects, and a time slider. Yishan developed a color legend and took a leading role in crafting the narrative for our write-up. Andrew further refined the user experience by adding detailed click event functionality and blur effects, along with dynamic line plots for individual regions. The interactive features presented the most significant time investment. Perfecting the clicking functionality and ensuring that the position of line plots provided valuable insights without overwhelming the user took considerable experimentation and testing.
